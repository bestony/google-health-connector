pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by [better-auth](https://better-auth.com), persisted through
[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) on libSQL/SQLite.

| File                        | Role                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/lib/auth.server.ts`    | better-auth instance (`getAuth()`), Drizzle adapter, plugins — server only |
| `src/lib/auth-client.ts`    | Browser client (`signIn`, `signUp`, `signOut`, `useSession`)             |
| `src/lib/session.ts`        | `fetchSession` server function + `sessionQueryOptions()` cache entry     |
| `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts`  | Mounts every better-auth endpoint under `/api/auth/*`                    |
| `src/db/auth-schema.ts`     | Generated Drizzle tables: `user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`   |
| `src/db/client.server.ts`   | Lazy Drizzle/libSQL client (`getDb()`)                                   |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in (`openssl rand -base64 32` for the secret),
then create the tables:

```bash
pnpm test:pushdb   # drizzle-kit push — fastest for local development

# or, when you want a reviewable migration history:
pnpm db:generate   # write a migration to ./drizzle
pnpm db:migrate    # apply it
```

The root route resolves the session in `beforeLoad` and puts it on the router context, so
any route can guard itself without an extra round trip:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/dashboard')({
  beforeLoad: ({ context, location }) => {
    if (!context.session) {
      throw redirect({ to: '/login', search: { redirect: location.href } })
    }
  },
})
```

`/login` and `/dashboard` are working demos of that flow — restyle or delete them freely.

After changing the better-auth config (new plugins, `additionalFields`, …), regenerate the
tables with `pnpm auth:generate`. The generator still emits legacy `relations()` helpers
that drizzle-orm 1.x removed; delete those blocks from `src/db/auth-schema.ts` afterwards.

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Removing Tailwind CSS

If you prefer not to use Tailwind CSS:

1. Remove the demo pages in `src/routes/demo/`
2. Replace the Tailwind import in `src/styles.css` with your own styles
3. Remove `tailwindcss()` from the plugins array in `vite.config.ts`
4. Remove `@tailwindcss/vite` and `tailwindcss` from `package.json`

## Linting & Formatting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. The following scripts are available:


```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm format
pnpm check
```


## Deploy with Nitro

This project uses Nitro as a generic server adapter, so it can run on any Node-compatible host.

```bash
npm run build
node dist/server/index.mjs
```

The build output is a self-contained Node server. To deploy, push the `dist/` directory to your host (Render, Fly.io, your own VPS, etc.) and run the server command above.

For host-specific presets (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, AWS Lambda, etc.) and tuning, see https://v3.nitro.build/deploy.



## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you render `{children}` in the `shellComponent`.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { HeadContent, Scripts, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      { charSet: 'utf-8' },
      { name: 'viewport', content: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1' },
      { title: 'My App' },
    ],
  }),
  shellComponent: ({ children }) => (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        <header>
          <nav>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
          </nav>
        </header>
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  ),
})
```

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Server Functions

TanStack Start provides server functions that allow you to write server-side code that seamlessly integrates with your client components.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const getServerTime = createServerFn({
  method: 'GET',
}).handler(async () => {
  return new Date().toISOString()
})

// Use in a component
function MyComponent() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState('')
  
  useEffect(() => {
    getServerTime().then(setTime)
  }, [])
  
  return <div>Server time: {time}</div>
}
```

## API Routes

You can create API routes by using the `server` property in your route definitions:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/hello')({
  server: {
    handlers: {
      GET: () => json({ message: 'Hello, World!' }),
    },
  },
})
```

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/people')({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json()
  },
  component: PeopleComponent,
})

function PeopleComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData()
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.results.map((person) => (
        <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).
